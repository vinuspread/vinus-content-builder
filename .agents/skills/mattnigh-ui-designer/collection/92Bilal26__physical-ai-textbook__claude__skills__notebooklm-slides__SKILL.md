# NotebookLM Slides Generation

## Context & Problem

AI-generated educational slides converge toward generic patterns:
- Text-heavy slides that read like lecture notes rather than presentations
- Missing pedagogical alignment with target proficiency levels
- Generic examples disconnected from educational philosophy
- Unclear narrative progression without learning psychology
- One-size-fits-all approach ignoring audience prerequisites

This skill provides structured prompt engineering that transforms NotebookLM's slide generation from generic outputs into pedagogically-sound, framework-aligned presentations.

## Core Principles

1. **Proficiency-Driven Design**: Slides must match CEFR levels (A1/A2 for beginners, B1/B2 for intermediate, C1/C2 for advanced)
2. **Framework Alignment**: Educational philosophy must be explicitly stated and integrated throughout
3. **Visual Over Textual**: Presenter slides with 3-5 bullet points, not dense paragraphs
4. **Narrative Progression**: Slides tell a story with clear arc (problem → transformation → opportunity → action)
5. **Actionable Takeaways**: End with concrete next steps, not vague summaries

## Dimensional Guidance

### Audience Definition
- **Avoid**: Vague audience descriptions ("students", "learners")
- **Prefer**: Specific proficiency + prerequisites + context ("A2 beginners with no programming experience discovering AI-native development")
- **Principle**: The more specific the audience definition, the better NotebookLM can calibrate tone and depth
- **Why it matters**: Prevents slides that are too advanced or too simplistic

### Educational Framework Specification
- **Avoid**: Assuming NotebookLM knows your teaching philosophy
- **Prefer**: Explicit framework with 3-5 core principles explained ("AI-native development: AI is your core partner, not just a helper")
- **Principle**: State the mental models you want students to develop
- **Why it matters**: Generic slides lack the distinctive perspective that makes content memorable

### Theme Articulation
- **Avoid**: Topic lists without context ("cover Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr")
- **Prefer**: Numbered themes with specific data/facts ("$3 trillion developer economy transforming in 2-3 years instead of typical 10-15 year cycle")
- **Principle**: Concrete details make abstract concepts tangible
- **Why it matters**: Specificity drives engagement and retention

### Tone Calibration
- **Avoid**: Single-word tone descriptors ("professional", "friendly")
- **Prefer**: Multi-faceted tone with contrasts ("Encouraging and empowering (not intimidating), future-focused and opportunity-driven")
- **Principle**: Tone shapes emotional response to content
- **Why it matters**: Wrong tone can alienate beginners or bore experts

### Format Specification
- **Avoid**: Leaving format to NotebookLM's defaults
- **Prefer**: Explicit constraints ("12-15 clean, visual slides with 3-5 bullet points per slide")
- **Principle**: Constraints enable creativity within bounds
- **Why it matters**: Prevents text-heavy slides that don't work for presentations

## Structured Prompt Template

```

## Workflow (6 Steps, 25-35 minutes)

### Prerequisites (First-Time Setup, ~2 min)

**Required**: Google account with NotebookLM access

**Setup Steps**:
1. Navigate to `notebooklm.google.com` in your browser
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Wait for NotebookLM dashboard to load
4. You're ready to create your first notebook

**Note**: NotebookLM is currently available in the US and select regions. Check availability at `notebooklm.google.com`.

### Generation Workflow

**1. Create Notebook & Upload Sources** (3-5 min)
- Click **"Create notebook"** (or open existing notebook for your chapter)
- Add descriptive title: `"Chapter X: [Chapter Title]"` (e.g., "Chapter 2: The AI Turning Point")
- Click **"Add source"** → Choose upload method:
  - **Website**: Paste deployed lesson URLs (recommended for published content)
  - **Upload**: Upload markdown files directly (for draft content)
- Upload ALL lesson files + chapter README + quiz file (if exists)
- **Verify with Source Upload Checklist**:
  - [ ] **Count matches**: Total sources = lesson files + README + quiz
    - Example: Chapter 31 has 8 lessons + 1 README + 1 quiz = 10 sources
  - [ ] **All files uploaded**: No "Upload failed" errors in UI
  - [ ] **Processing complete**: NotebookLM shows "X sources" (not "Processing...")
- **If mismatch detected**:
  1. Check for missing quiz file (often forgotten)
  2. Verify README was included (provides chapter overview context)
  3. Re-upload any failed files individually
  4. **Do NOT proceed to slide generation** with incomplete sources
- **Why verification matters**: Missing sources = incomplete slides missing key concepts
- **Tip**: For consistency, use the same source method (Website OR Upload) for all lessons in a chapter

**2. Configure Slide Deck** (1 min)
- In the **Studio** panel (right side), click **"Slide Deck"**
- NotebookLM will show: _"Generate an AI slide deck based on your sources"_
- Click the message to open configuration
- **Format**: Select **"Presenter Slides"** (not "Educational Slides")
- **Length**: Choose **"Default"** (12-15 slides) or **"Long"** (18-25 slides) based on proficiency level
- **Customization**: Click **"Customize"** to open prompt input area

**3. Prompt Engineering** (5 min)
- Paste your customized template using dimensional guidance framework
- **Required components**:
  - Proficiency level (A2/B1/C1)
  - Framework principles (3-5 core concepts)
  - Numbered themes (5-7 specific themes with data/facts)
  - Multi-faceted tone (with contrasts: "X not Y")
  - Format constraints (slide count, bullets per slide, narrative arc)
- **Review**: Ensure all 5 dimensions are explicitly stated
- Click **"Generate"** button

**4. Generate & Review** (10-30 min - VARIABLE!)
- **Wait**: Generation typically takes 5-10 minutes
- **IMPORTANT**: Some chapters may take 20-35+ minutes (observed with complex content or longer sources)
- **Do NOT assume failure** if progress indicator shows "Generating..." beyond 15 minutes
- **Signs generation is working normally**:
  - Progress indicator animating (not frozen)
  - Browser tab responsive (not crashed)
  - No error messages displayed
- **If stuck beyond 30 minutes**:
  - Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
  - Verify NotebookLM hasn't shown "daily limit reached" message
  - Consider checking page in new tab (generation may have completed but UI not updated)
  - If after 45+ minutes with no progress: Cancel and regenerate with simplified prompt
- **Review with structured success criteria** when slides appear:

<success_criteria>
REQUIRED (must pass all 7 criteria):
- [ ] **Title reflects framework** (not generic like "Introduction to...")
     - ✅ PASS: "The AI Coding Revolution" (reflects AI-native philosophy)
     - ❌ FAIL: "Chapter 1: Getting Started with AI"
- [ ] **Language matches proficiency level**
     - A2: Simple vocabulary, short sentences, no jargon
     - B1: Moderate complexity, some technical terms with explanations
     - C1: Industry-standard terminology, nuanced language
- [ ] **All 5-7 numbered themes covered with specific data**
     - Check each theme from prompt appears in slides
     - Verify concrete examples, facts, numbers included (not vague generalities)
- [ ] **Tone matches specification**
     - Verify contrasts present ("X not Y")
     - Check emotional framing (encouraging, rigorous, etc.)
- [ ] **Slide count within range**
     - A2: 12-15 slides | B1: 15-20 slides | C1: 20-25 slides
     - Count total slides to verify
- [ ] **Narrative arc present**
     - Follows progression: problem → transformation → opportunity → action
     - Not random topic sequence
- [ ] **Ending is actionable**
     - Concrete next steps (specific tasks, resources, exercises)
     - ❌ FAIL: Vague encouragement like "Keep learning!" or "Good luck!"

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: ___/10

If score < 8/10 confidence → Iterate with refined prompt
</success_criteria>

- **Quick Validation Commands**:

**Check slide count** (after download, macOS):
```bash
mdls -name kMDItemNumberOfPages "chapter-XX-slides.pdf"
```

**Verify themes coverage** (manual):
  - Open PDF and scan slide titles
  - Check each of 5-7 numbered themes from prompt appears
  - Flag any missing themes for iteration

**Confidence Scoring Guide**:
  - **9-10/10**: All 7 criteria pass, themes fully covered, tone perfect → Deploy
  - **7-8/10**: 5-6 criteria pass, minor tone/format adjustments needed → Consider iteration
  - **5-6/10**: 3-4 criteria pass, significant iteration required → Refine prompt
  - **<5/10**: Start over with refined prompt focusing on failed dimensions

- **Iterate if needed**: If slides miss the mark, click **"Edit"** and refine prompt with more explicit constraints focusing on failed criteria

**5. Deploy** (3 min)
- Click **"Download"** button (appears after generation)
- PDF downloads to your browser's default location

**File Naming Standard**:
- **Format**: `chapter-{NN}-slides.pdf` where NN is zero-padded
- **Examples**:
  - Chapter 1 → `chapter-01-slides.pdf` (NOT `chapter-1-slides.pdf`)
  - Chapter 12 → `chapter-12-slides.pdf`
  - Chapter 31 → `chapter-31-slides.pdf`
- **Why zero-padding**: Ensures correct alphabetical sorting in file systems

**Renaming & Moving**:
```bash
# Example for Chapter 1:
mv ~/Downloads/"The-AI-Coding-Revolution.pdf" "book-source/static/slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"

# Example for Chapter 31:
mv ~/Downloads/"Designing-Reusable-Intelligence.pdf" "book-source/static/slides/chapter-31-slides.pdf"
```

- **Integration Path**: All slides must be in `book-source/static/slides/` directory

**6. Integrate into Documentation** (2 min)
- Open chapter README: `book-source/docs/[part]/[chapter]/README.md`
- Add slides metadata to frontmatter (YAML at top of file):

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: "Chapter 1: [Chapter Title]"
slides:
  source: "slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"
  title: "Chapter 1: [Chapter Title]"
  height: 700
---

# Chapter 1: [Chapter Title]

[Chapter introduction content...]

## 🎯 Before You Begin

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:
- [Learning objectives...]
```

**Integration Details:**
- **Location**: Add `slides:` metadata in frontmatter YAML block at top of file
- **Format**: Use object format with `source`, `title`, and `height` fields
- **Source Path**: Use relative path `slides/chapter-XX-slides.pdf` (NOT absolute path `/slides/...`)
- **Automatic Injection**: Build-time plugin automatically injects PDFViewer component BEFORE "What You'll Learn" heading
- **No Manual Import**: Do NOT add `import PDFViewer` or JSX components (handled automatically)
- **Placement**: Slides appear after "## 🎯 Before You Begin" and before "## What You'll Learn"
- **Rationale**: Progressive disclosure - students see big picture (slides) before detailed objectives

**Alternative Simple Format** (for quick integration):
```yaml
---
title: "Chapter Title"
slides: "slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"
---
```
This uses default height (700) and default title ("Chapter Slides").

**Verification:**
- Save file and build Docusaurus: `npm run build`
- Check build output for: `[Slides Transformer] ✅ Injected slides/chapter-XX-slides.pdf`
- Verify slides appear correctly in deployed site

### Metadata-Driven Architecture (NEW)

**What Changed:**
The integration workflow now uses **metadata-driven slide injection** instead of manual JSX components.

**Old Approach (Deprecated):**
```markdown
import PDFViewer from '@site/src/components/PDFViewer';

<PDFViewer src="slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf" title="..." height={700} />
```

**New Approach (Current):**
```yaml
---
slides:
  source: "slides/chapter-01-slides.pdf"
  title: "Chapter 1: Title"
  height: 700
---
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Cleaner Content**: No JSX imports or components cluttering markdown
- ✅ **Consistent Placement**: Automatic injection before "What You'll Learn" (no manual positioning)
- ✅ **Cloud-Ready**: Supports both local paths (`slides/file.pdf`) and URLs (`https://cdn.example.com/file.pdf`)
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Update metadata, not JSX code
- ✅ **Build-Time Processing**: Remark plugin handles transformation automatically

**How It Works:**
1. Frontmatter metadata specifies slides source, title, and height
2. Build-time remark plugin reads frontmatter during Docusaurus compilation
3. Plugin finds "What You'll Learn" heading in markdown AST
4. Plugin injects PDFViewer component node before that heading
5. Docusaurus compiles MDX with component already in place
6. Result: Clean HTML with slides embedded at correct location

**For Cloud Migration:**
When PDFs move to Cloudflare R2/S3, simply update the `source` field to the URL:
```yaml
slides:
  source: "https://r2.cloudflare.com/tutorsgpt/slides/chapter-01.pdf"
  title: "Chapter 1: Title"
  height: 700
```
No code changes needed—just metadata updates.

### Time Estimates by Experience Level

| Experience | First Chapter | Subsequent Chapters | Batch (3 chapters) |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **First-time user** | 35-50 min | 25-35 min | 90-150 min |
| **Experienced user** | 20-30 min | 15-25 min | 60-90 min |

**Efficiency gains**: After 2-3 chapters, you'll develop muscle memory for prompt engineering and can reuse/adapt previous successful prompts.

**Time Variability Notes**:
- Generation time varies widely (5-35 minutes per chapter)
- Complex chapters with more sources take longer
- Daily limits may require splitting work across multiple days
- Batch processing saves ~25% time through parallel preparation/generation

## 🚨 Daily Limit Troubleshooting

**Symptom**: "You have reached your daily Slides limits" message appears after clicking "Generate"

**What this means**:
- NotebookLM enforces per-account daily slide generation limits
- Limit resets at midnight Pacific Time (Google servers)
- Notebooks remain available; only slide generation is blocked
- Exact limit unknown (observed: 3-5 chapters per day depending on complexity)

**Recovery Options**:
1. **Wait Method**: Return after 24 hours and continue from Step 4 (notebooks persist)
2. **Account Switching**: Use different Google account if available (requires re-creating notebooks)
3. **Batch Planning**: Plan to generate 3-5 chapters per day maximum across multiple days

**Prevention Strategy**:
- Track chapters completed per day in project progress tracker
- Schedule batch work across multiple days for large parts (e.g., Part 4 with 18 chapters = 4-6 days)
- Generate slides for highest-priority chapters first each day

**If blocked mid-batch**:
- Notebooks with uploaded sources are saved
- Resume slide generation next day starting at Step 2 (Configure Slide Deck)
- No need to re-upload sources

---

## Batch Processing Multiple Chapters

For processing 3+ chapters in one session (recommended for Parts with multiple chapters):

### Preparation Phase (10-15 min)
1. **Create all notebooks with titles FIRST** (before any slide generation)
2. **Upload sources for all chapters** (notebooks persist independently)
3. **Prepare all prompts in text editor** (adapt from proficiency-calibrated templates)
4. **Review chapter-index.md** to confirm proficiency levels match templates

### Generation Phase (per chapter, 15-30 min each)
5. Generate slides for Chapter N
6. **While Chapter N generates**, prepare/refine prompt for Chapter N+1 in text editor
7. Download Chapter N PDF when ready
8. **Start Chapter N+1 generation immediately**
9. Rename/move Chapter N PDF while N+1 generates (parallel work)

### Integration Phase (bulk, 10-15 min)
10. Move all PDFs to `book-source/static/slides/` at once
11. Add slides metadata to frontmatter in all chapter READMEs sequentially
12. Verify all slides load correctly in local Docusaurus build (`npm run build`)

### Time Savings
- **Sequential approach**: 3 chapters × 25 min = 75 min
- **Batch approach**: Setup (15 min) + Generation (45 min overlapped) + Integration (15 min) = ~60 min
- **Savings**: ~25% reduction through parallel preparation/generation

### Daily Limit Awareness
- Plan for **3-5 chapters maximum per day**
- If limit hit: Stop, update progress tracker, resume next day
- For large parts (e.g., Part 4 with 18 chapters): Schedule 4-6 days of work

---

## Automation via Playwright MCP (Optional Advanced)

For batch processing multiple chapters with browser automation:

### Prerequisites
- Playwright MCP server installed and configured in Claude Code
- Google account credentials ready
- Access to NotebookLM sources (markdown files or deployed URLs)

### Workflow Pattern (per chapter)
1. Navigate to `notebooklm.google.com` and authenticate
2. Create notebook with standardized title
3. Upload sources via file upload dialog (automate file selection)
4. Navigate to "Slide Deck" in Studio panel
5. Configure format (Presenter Slides, Default/Long length)
6. Paste prompt into customization field
7. Click "Generate" and monitor (5-30 min wait)
8. Detect completion (download button appears)
9. Download PDF to `.playwright-mcp/` directory
10. Move PDF to `book-source/static/slides/` with standardized naming
11. Update chapter README frontmatter with slides metadata (automated text manipulation)

### Benefits
- **Time Savings**: ~40% faster for 3+ chapters due to reduced context switching
- **Consistency**: Standardized naming, no manual typos
- **Automation**: Can queue multiple chapters

### Limitations
- **Technical Setup Required**: MCP server configuration, browser automation knowledge
- **Daily Limits Still Apply**: Cannot bypass NotebookLM's per-account limits
- **Extended Wait Times**: Require patient monitoring (30+ min generations)
- **Error Handling**: Must handle stuck generations, timeouts, UI changes

### When to Use
- Processing 5+ chapters in batch
- Repetitive workflow across similar chapters
- Team environment with automation infrastructure

### When NOT to Use
- First 1-2 chapters (learn manual workflow first)
- Chapters requiring significant prompt iteration
- One-off slide generation

---

## Required Behaviors (Positive Framing)

Follow these essential practices for high-quality slide generation:

### ✅ Audience Specification
- **DO**: Use specific proficiency-calibrated audience descriptions with prerequisites
  - Example: "A2 beginners with no programming experience discovering AI-native development"
- **WHY**: Enables NotebookLM to calibrate tone, complexity, and vocabulary appropriately

### ✅ Framework Alignment
- **DO**: Explicitly state your educational framework with 3-5 core principles
  - Example: "AI-native development: AI is your core partner (not just a helper)"
- **WHY**: NotebookLM doesn't know your teaching philosophy unless you make it explicit

### ✅ Concrete Examples
- **DO**: Include specific data, facts, and numbers in your numbered themes
  - Example: "$3 trillion developer economy transforming in 2-3 years"
- **WHY**: Specificity makes abstract concepts tangible and memorable

### ✅ Multi-Faceted Tone
- **DO**: Describe tone with contrasts and context
  - Example: "Encouraging (not intimidating) — beginners may feel overwhelmed"
- **WHY**: Single-word descriptors are ambiguous; context enables accurate calibration

### ✅ Explicit Format Constraints
- **DO**: Specify slide count range, bullets per slide, and use XML tags
  - Example: `<slide_format_requirements>Generate exactly 12-15 slides...</slide_format_requirements>`
- **WHY**: Prevents text-heavy lecture notes; ensures presenter-friendly slides

### ✅ Narrative Progression
- **DO**: Define clear narrative arc with problem → transformation → opportunity → action
  - Example: "Start with current pain points, show transformation, end with next steps"
- **WHY**: Pedagogical progression builds understanding incrementally

### ✅ Actionable Endings
- **DO**: End with concrete, specific next steps
  - Example: "Complete Chapter 2 exercises, set up development environment, join Discord"
- **WHY**: Vague summaries ("Keep learning!") provide no guidance for student action

## Creative Variance

NotebookLM tends to:
- Default to academic/lecture tone even when asked for accessible style
- Create text-heavy slides despite "visual" requests
- Use generic titles instead of engaging ones
- Skip the emotional/motivational framing

Counter this by:
- Reinforcing tone with contrasts: "Encouraging (not academic)"
- Explicitly requesting "3-5 bullet points per slide (not paragraphs)"
- Providing example of engaging title style in prompt
- Including "opportunity-driven" or "transformation-focused" in tone

Vary slide structure: Don't always use bullet points. Request timelines, comparison tables, process flows, or numbered steps when appropriate to the content.

## Concrete Example: Chapter 1 AI Development (A2)

**Prompt Used:**
```
Create an inspiring slide deck for absolute beginners (A2 proficiency level) learning AI-driven software development.

AUDIENCE: Complete beginners with no prior programming experience discovering that AI has fundamentally changed how software is built.

AI-NATIVE DEVELOPMENT TO EMPHASIZE:
• AI as Core Partner: AI is your primary development partner, not just a helper tool
• Role Transformation: From "typist" (writing syntax) to "orchestrator" (directing AI)
• Spec-Driven Development: You write specifications; AI generates implementations
• Co-Learning: Humans and AI learn together through iteration

KEY THEMES TO HIGHLIGHT:
1. The $3 trillion developer economy transformation happening NOW
2. Why this moment is an OPPORTUNITY, not a threat (AI lowers barriers)
3. The shift from syntax memorization to specification writing and system design
4. Evolution through 4 generations: code completion → chat → agentic coding → autonomous agents
5. What makes you valuable: judgment, architecture, domain expertise, orchestration skills

TONE & STYLE:
• Encouraging and empowering (not intimidating) — these slides will be presented to absolute beginners who may feel overwhelmed by AI development, so maintaining an encouraging tone is critical to prevent dropout
• Future-focused and opportunity-driven — frame AI as opening doors, not closing them
• Clear, simple language avoiding jargon — learners have no technical background yet
• Action-oriented: what students should DO next

<slide_format_requirements>
Generate exactly 12-15 slides total. Each slide must contain 3-5 concise bullet points written as complete sentences, NOT dense paragraph text. Use visual hierarchy with clear headings. This slide deck should comprehensively cover the chapter content using your full output context to create a thorough, well-structured presentation. Don't artificially limit scope—make sure you address all major themes before concluding.
</slide_format_requirements>

NARRATIVE ARC:
• Progressive structure: problem → transformation → opportunity → action
• End with clear, actionable next steps for learners (specific tasks, not vague encouragement)
```

**Result:** "The AI Coding Revolution" - 13 slides, all themes covered, encouraging tone, actionable ✅

## Success Indicators

**Working:**
- ✅ Title matches framework ("AI Coding Revolution" reflects AI-native philosophy)
- ✅ Proficiency-appropriate (simple vocabulary for A2, no jargon)
- ✅ All 5 themes covered with specific data ($3T economy, 4 generations)
- ✅ Tone consistent (encouraging, not academic)
- ✅ Format followed (13 slides, 3-5 bullets each)
- ✅ Clear arc (problem → transformation → opportunity → action)
- ✅ Actionable ending (concrete next steps)

**Failed:**
- ❌ Generic title ("Introduction to AI Development")
- ❌ Text-heavy paragraphs instead of bullets
- ❌ Missing numbered themes
- ❌ Academic tone for beginners
- ❌ Random sequence without progression
- ❌ Vague takeaways ("Keep learning!")
